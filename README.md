# Person Detection with YOLO and Faster R-CNN


## Overview

This repository implements person detection using two powerful object detection models: YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network). The models are trained on a dedicated dataset for person detection and then deployed using Hugging Face and Gradio for easy and interactive inference.

## Models Used

1. **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** YOLO is a real-time object detection algorithm capable of detecting multiple objects in an image with high accuracy and speed.

2. **Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network):** Faster R-CNN is another widely used object detection model that utilizes region proposals to localize and classify objects in an image.

## Usage

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/person-detection.git
cd person-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
